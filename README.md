NAVIGATION

Aim: For the navigation system to be clear, legible, and consistent. (How To Create A Great Navigation Menu Bar Design, n.d.)

Current state: Compared to the original website, I have significantly reduced the number of navigation items, for a system that is much easier to understand. Minimalism and functionality are not synonyms, however, and I still feel I could have made it more intriguing somehow (a vertical system for example.)

Moving forward: As of right now, I have no way of highlighting the current page it is very important to fix this as to not confuse users. This can be simply fixed with a permanent underline on the navigation item. Depending on how intertwining my website navigation becomes, it may be helpful to include a breadcrumb system also.

FOOTER

Aim: To improve overall site usability. (Website Footers, 2022)

Current state: Due to the simplicity of the navigation system, the footer sitemap is mostly repeats of existing links. While this can still be useful to some, I feel it is an unnecessary waste of space as of right now. It is still missing a logo and is not responsive on very small screens, both will be simple fixes. The incorporation of (Playlist Carousel - Css Only, n.d.) code was my first ever attempt at input items but has been well integrated into my existing code.

Moving forward: Aside from fixing the issues discussed above, I also wish to include an acknowledgement of country. This is both relevant and vital to the website, and I believe it can be cohesive, just as any other footer element is.

HOME

Aim: To make a powerful first impression on the site visitor. (writer, 2021)

Current state: I’m unsure if my home page clearly states the business and its purpose. It will be worth testing with potential users to conclude whether I should make more of an effort to do so. Use of black and white colour and bold fonts is consistent with other websites I had explored in my early research (). This will hence attract a similar audience. I have attempted to clearly segment different pieces of information here too. Something that is particularly important on the home page because of the combination of different subject matters within one page. I should have used more interactive elements here since they would direct users to deeper sections within the website. The current elements do provide opportunity for updating in the future so that my audience has reason to revisit the website in the future.

Moving forward: I feel as though the hero element doesn’t clearly state that it is a temporary, upcoming event. To make it feel less static and header-like, I hope to turn it into a slideshow of events which would hugely influence the way the subconscious views each item.

ABOUT

Aim: To give an insight into the company as well as sharing personal experience and stories. (27 Best About Us and About Me Page Examples [+Templates], 2023)

Current State: Off the bat, shapes a clear and engaging mission statement as well as giving reasoning behind their immense passion for Canberra’s architecture. There is also opportunity for the user to interact with the company and submit any enquiries they may have.

Moving forward: I hope to delve further into each person’s connection to the company. This would project their passion to remote users and push for higher interactivity. Unfortunately, this is limited by the number of available sources on the topic. Some images are also loading in slower than others, likely due to linking the images rather than embedding them as assets. I did fix this in future pages and have noticed a vast improvement in loading speeds.

EVENTS

Aim: To utilise intriguing imagery and have a clear display of relevant information. (‘24 Event Website Examples to Inspire a New Design | Eventbrite’, 2023)

Current State: Since my site is still in the production phase, my events page currently only consists of one event. This was to define the general structure as well as test out the credibility of my initial wireframes. Here I have used a tagging system that allows quick access to related events (therefore further exploration) as well as an easy filtering mechanism for my final events page. Unfortunately, each page is very short, once again due to lack of resources.

Moving forward: To avoid the events page being the final destination for users, I aim to include recommendations for upcoming events at the bottom of each page. This will increase the amount of call to action within my site as well as a higher engagement.  My final events page will include a series of filter systems and search options.
